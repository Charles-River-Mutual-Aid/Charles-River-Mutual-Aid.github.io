                    With the World Health Organization declaring the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global
                    pandemic,
                    and schools and universities closing and moving classes online, activists from various universities
                    are mobilizing to provide mutual aid to students and other Boston-area residents who are in need of
                    resources. For students who have been kicked off their campuses, we will try to provide housing and
                    storage
                    space, although this is limited. We will be pooling funds in a Mutual Aid Fund to purchase food,
                    medical
                    supplies, and other necessities, and organizing to provide these resources to the community.

                    The current pandemic is something that we in the United States have never had to deal with before,
                    and
                    the
                    times ahead will be difficult for millions of people. While our culture encourages
                    us to withdraw from society and only “look out for number one”, we must fight back against the
                    tendency
                    to
                    isolate ourselves. Now more than ever, we must come together to support each other—students,
                    workers,
                    faculty, and community members alike—as the government becomes increasingly unable to provide basic
                    resources. </br></br>

                    We know the virus is going to affect some people more than others. The rich and the powerful will
                    get
                    it too, but they will have access to medical care and resources that <a
                        href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/">
                        tens millions of people in the U.S. do not have.
                    </a> We know how the U.S. government handles similar situations - we saw Katrina in New Orleans,
                    where
                    white residents were evacuated and the majority-Black Ninth Ward was devastated. The hurricane
                    itself was a natural
                    disaster, but the effects it had on people were man-made.

                <p>
                    Join us in our Mutual Aid Program to serve the people and fight back against COVID-19! If we want to
                    avoid a disaster we have to urgently organize to meet the needs of the people which the government
                    and big institutions are going to neglect.
