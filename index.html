                    People here in Boston aren't the only ones dealing with this crisis and getting organized. In the
                    Bay
                    Area, which has one of the largest homeless populations in the country, people are getting organized
                    to
                    push the city government to take care of homeless residents. <a

                    Charles River Mutual Aid Program (CRMAP) is a group of activists from across the Boston area who are
                    mobilizing to provide mutual aid to residents in the area in need of resources. We are pooling funds
                    in a Mutual Aid Fund to purchase food, medical supplies, and other necessities for people who
                    request them, and organizing to provide these resources to the community. In addition, we seek to
                    bring people together and partner with other organizations to help fight back against capitalism’s
                    injustices during this crisis, injustices such as the predatory collection of unpayable rents at a
                    time when tenants are losing their sources of income.

                    As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreads like wildfire in the US, millions of people are being
                    left out to dry. University students are being told to “think creatively” to find housing as they
                    get evicted en masse. Businesses are shutting down and laying off their workers, meaning millions of
                    working families are losing part or all of their income. Many businesses that remain open are
                    putting their workers in hazardous conditions. Our profit-driven economy, which in normal times
                    already fails to meet people’s basic needs, is proving to be especially catastrophic for the people
                    in this time of crisis.

                <p>
                    The current pandemic is something that we in the United States have never had to deal with before,
                    and the times ahead will be difficult for millions of people. While our culture encourages us to
                    withdraw from society and “look out for number one”, we must fight back against the tendency to
                    isolate ourselves. Now more than ever, we must come together to support each other—students,
                    workers, tenants, and everyone committed to justice—as the government becomes increasingly unable to
                    provide basic resources.

                    We know the virus is going to affect some people more than others. The rich and the powerful will
                    catch it too, but at much lower rates due to their ability to protect themselves, and they will have
                    access to medical care and resources that <a
                        href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/">
                        tens millions of people in the U.S. do not have.
                    </a> . We
                    know how the U.S. government handles similar situations - we saw hurricane Katrina in New Orleans,
                    where white residents were evacuated and the majority-Black Ninth Ward was devastated. The hurricane
                    itself was a natural disaster, but the effects it had on people were man-made.

                <p>
                    Join us in our Mutual Aid Program, by volunteering or donating, to serve the people and fight back
                    against COVID-19! If we want to help each other survive this disaster, we must urgently organize,
                    and we must assert and address the needs of the people in opposition to the interests of the
                    landlords, the bosses, and their government.
